# Day 3 – Comments and Constants in C++

Today I learned two basic concepts in C++: **comments** and **constants**.

## Comments in C++

Comments are notes inside the code that help explain what the code is doing.
The computer ignores comments — they are only for humans to read.

Single-line comment:

```cpp
// This is a comment
```

Multi-line comment:

```cpp
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

I use comments to remember what my code does and to make it easier to understand later.

## Constants in C++

A constant is a value that **cannot be changed** after it is created.
We use the keyword `const` to make a constant.

Example:

```cpp
const int number = 10;
```

Here, `number` will always stay 10 and cannot be changed.

Constants are useful because they protect important values in a program.

## What I practiced today

* Writing comments in my code
* Creating constants using `const`
* Understanding why constants are important

✔ Day 3 completed – practiced basic C++ concepts.
