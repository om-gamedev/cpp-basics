Day 3: Learning bool, float, and double in C++

Today I learned about different data types in C++:

• bool – used to store true or false values. It is helpful for conditions and decision making in programs.

• float – used to store decimal numbers with single precision. It takes less memory and is useful for simple calculations.

• double – used to store decimal numbers with higher precision than float. It is better when more accurate values are needed.

I practiced writing small programs using these data types to understand how they work in real code. This helps build a strong foundation in C++ basics.
